**Explore Existing Ideas**

| Website | Plus | Minus | Implications |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Facebook | Free platform that allows for the sharing of photos, updates and ideas. Can be used to connect with parents and community, and share news and achievements (For example the Gosford High facebook account) Easy to access many features from just the home page. Fits many features into one page | Addictive layout with a very large array of features available to users (messaging, watching, commenting, etc.) Can influence self-esteem through content. Misinformation spreads very quickly. Extremely cluttered with heavy ui elements | For my web app, I can learn from Facebook’s ability to keep people engaged and connected, perhaps by adding features like a forum. Further, I should incorporate a simpler ui, which can prevent users feeling overwhelmed by the layout of the page. |
| Google | Provides very easy access to an extremely large range of web pages. Useful for students in that it is very easy to find material for research, revision and study tips. Simplistic home page UI. Easily accessible and intuitive. | Influences information intake of users by showing most popular results first instead of most reliable Certain features may be difficult to locate due to the minimalist style Ads look similar to actual results | For my web app, I should provide clear, reliable, and simple information about stress so students can easily process this information, especially if they are stressed. Unlike Google, my app will only focus on student wellbeing and stress management avoiding the overabundance of information. |
| Youtube | Extremely large library of free videos. Wide selection of different content. Extremely accessible. Can inspire creativity, music and hobbies. UI is focused on the video aspect, concentrates on the video and thumbnail aspect  | Influences user habits by showing algorithm based content \- can be addictive Videos can expose users to negative beliefs or comments The homepage may be overwhelming with the amount of cluttered content. | For my web app, I can learn from YouTube’s engaging use of visuals, but avoid distractions. I can also add visuals and videos to add some engagement. Further, I can take inspiration from the way that they centralise certain elements of the website, by emphasising the more important parts or words within the website.- |

**Secondary Research**

Study stress is one of the biggest concerns of young people today. According to the young mental health service *ReachOut* almost 50% of young people feel extremely or very stressed about study and exams, with 46% of young people indicating that study stress has a major impact on their mental health and wellbeing. This research indicates the undeniable presence of stress within the student population, and can be linked to physical consequences. For example, according to *AtticusHealth*, prolonged stress can lead to increased chances of developing depression and anxiety, which can impact a student’s academic performance, social relationships, and physical health. Furthermore, stress can result in physical consequences such as sleep disturbances, headaches, digestive problems, and even a weakened immune system. A large percentage of the student population are exposed to these physical consequences that may affect their emotions and focus but also disrupts their daily functioning. As a step forward, I will make it a significant priority to implement pages or information on how stress can affect oneself, in order to illuminate why a student should not remain stressed.

There are many methods in order to effectively manage studies in order to avoid stress. According to an article by *Melbourne University,* some methods to reduce study stress include talking with someone, developing healthy work habits, revising your timetable, prioritising workload and focusing on one major task at a time. Strategies such as these will be a significant drive to my web app and will be among the primary pages, in order to help students alleviate stress. My website will further feature some dedicated features that revolve around some of these strategies. For example, including a schedule maker or time planner to assist with time management. Further, a technique to assist in promoting study in students is the Pomodoro Technique which involves breaking study time into focused intervals with short breaks in between (25 minute work, 5 minute break). This can promote concentration while preventing burnout during studies. An addition such as a Pomodoro timer allows for a practical tool of student benefit within my website.
