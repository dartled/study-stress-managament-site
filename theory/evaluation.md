# Peer Evaluation

> Darrell Campoy's product, StudyZen, offers a reliable and functional solution to manage student study stress and issues alike through a web application build on the sophisticated use of flask and JavaScript. He effectively utilises CSS to design his website into a user-friendly interface, with aesthetically pleasing colour schemes, which provide a sense of encouragement for the target user, which meets the purpose for this web app. A simplistic font is used, although some text proportions feel off, such as the slightly small font used for the navbar, but is merely an aesthetic concern.
The web app features 2 functional tools, the timer and study planner, which were constructed effectively with flask and JS. The pomodoro timer features an extremely minimalistic design with soft colours, seemingly designed to negate distractions which helps the user focus. However, the page could've featured a navbar or a back button to help the user navigate back to home when they need to access another page of the website elsewhere. The study planner is also well constructed, with an easy to use form that acts as input for the task, and then is displayed in an easy to read manner. In addition, his app features a login system, which increases convenience for the user to save their tasks over long periods of time.
There are a few minor improvements that could be made. For one, some of the design elements have slight disproportions, but can be solved with some CSS tweaks. In addition, the web app could also have been made accessible to mobile users by using media queries. Lastly, a footer could've also been implemented for easy access to every part of the website, as well as implementing the navbar in other places. Otherwise, Darrell's final product effectively impacts his target market positively, helping students to manage stress a lot better.

**Evaluation of Issues**

StudyZen addresses several important social, ethical, and legal issues through its design and functionality. Socially, the application provides students with a positive tool to reduce study stress and improve productivity by offering a Pomodoro timer and study planner that encourage healthier study habits. Ethically, it avoids exploitative design choices such as intrusive ads or manipulative patterns, instead prioritising user wellbeing with a distraction-free interface and calming colour scheme. Accessibility is partially addressed through clear fonts and contrasts, though mobile responsiveness and screen reader compatibility could be improved. Legally, the inclusion of a login system introduces responsibilities around user privacy and data protection. While StudyZen shows awareness of this by storing user credentials securely, it would benefit from clearer privacy policies and stronger encryption practices to ensure full compliance with data protection regulations.

**Project Evaluation**


The final product successfully meets its requirements by implementing the core features of a pomodoro timer, planner, and login system. My project aimed to assist students within managing their stress in schoolwork. Within in my web app I used html, css, flask and a bit of javascript to execute the site. 

The project demonstrates effective use of Flask, JavaScript, and CSS, with careful prioritisation of essential functions during development. While the application’s minimalistic design aligns with its purpose and positively impacts students by reducing distractions, some minor issues such as inconsistent font sizing, lack of mobile optimisation, and absence of a global navigation system could be improved with further development. Overall, StudyZen achieves its goals, demonstrates solid project management, and positively impacts its target market, with the potential to become even more effective and widely adopted if refined with additional accessibility and design improvements.
