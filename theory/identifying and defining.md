From my Impact/Effort Matrix and SWOT analysis, I can identify that both are worthwhile ideas but the student stress management app/website shows a clearer and more extensive impact. From my SWOT analysis, I noted that even though it would involve ensuring that information is trustworthy and users are actively involved, its strengths and advantages surpass its weaknesses significantly. It solves a universal problem faced by the student population directly since stress is continually shown in my survey responses as a key area of concern. Its ability to save students time by offering approaches in one location, in combination with potential collaboration and community involvement opportunities, make this concept extremely practical and sustainable. Based on consideration about these factors, I concluded I will pursue a student stress management app/website as my final concept.
