From my Impact/Effort Matrix and SWOT analysis, I can identify that both the student stress managament site and the self-diary milestone stie are worthwhile ideas but the student stress management app/website shows a clearer and more extensive impact. From my SWOT analysis, I noted that even though it would involve ensuring that information is trustworthy and users are actively involved, its strengths and advantages surpass its weaknesses significantly. It solves a problem faced by the student population directly since stress is as a key area of student concern. Its ability to save students time by offering approaches in one location, in combination with potential collaboration and community involvement opportunities, make this concept extremely practical and sustainable. Based on consideration about these factors, I have decided I will create a student stress management app/website as my final concept.
