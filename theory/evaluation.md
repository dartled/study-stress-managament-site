# Peer Evaluation

> Darrell Campoy's product, StudyZen, offers a reliable and functional solution to manage student study stress and issues alike through a web application build on the sophisticated use of flask and JavaScript. He effectively utilises CSS to design his website into a user-friendly interface, with aesthetically pleasing colour schemes, which provide a sense of encouragement for the target user, which meets the purpose for this web app. A simplistic font is used, although some text proportions feel off, such as the slightly small font used for the navbar, but is merely an aesthetic concern.
The web app features 2 functional tools, the timer and study planner, which were constructed effectively with flask and JS. The pomodoro timer features an extremely minimalistic design with soft colours, seemingly designed to negate distractions which helps the user focus. However, the page could've featured a navbar or a back button to help the user navigate back to home when they need to access another page of the website elsewhere. The study planner is also well constructed, with an easy to use form that acts as input for the task, and then is displayed in an easy to read manner. In addition, his app features a login system, which increases convenience for the user to save their tasks over long periods of time.
There are a few minor improvements that could be made. For one, some of the design elements have slight disproportions, but can be solved with some CSS tweaks. In addition, the web app could also have been made accessible to mobile users by using media queries. Lastly, a footer could've also been implemented for easy access to every part of the website, as well as implementing the navbar in other places. Otherwise, Darrell's final product effectively impacts his target market positively, helping students to manage stress a lot better.

**Evaluation of Issues**

StudyZen addresses several important social, ethical, and legal issues through its design and functionality. Socially, the application provides students with a positive tool to reduce study stress and improve productivity by offering a Pomodoro timer and study planner that encourage healthier study habits. Ethically, it avoids exploitative design choices such as intrusive ads or manipulative patterns, instead prioritising user wellbeing with a distraction-free interface and calming colour scheme. Accessibility is partially addressed through clear fonts and contrasts, though mobile responsiveness and screen reader compatibility could be improved. Legally, the inclusion of a login system introduces responsibilities around user privacy and data protection. While StudyZen shows awareness of this by storing user credentials securely, it would benefit from clearer privacy policies and stronger encryption practices to ensure full compliance with data protection regulations.

*Meeting requirements and Target Market*:
The purpose of my app was to help students manage stress and study workload. My final web app successfully meets a significant portion of my requirements such as implementing the core features of a Pomodoro timer, study planner, and login system. The Pomodoro timer allows users to start, pause, and reset sessions, encouraging focus through structured study and break intervals, while the planner enables adding, editing, and deleting study tasks, giving students a tool to organise their workload effectively. However, Two planned features, forums and study articles, were not implemented. Forums were excluded as they risked distracting users from their studies, and articles were excluded to prevent overwhelming students with excessive information. In terms of non-functional requirements, the app achieves good usability through its simple design, reliable performance of the timer and planner, and secure login system that protects user data, though issues such as inconsistent font sizing, limited mobile optimisation influenced usability. Overall, My web app achieves its primary purpose of supporting students in managing study-related stress.

*Project Managament:*
In managing this project, I found that my ambition slightly exceeded my execution, which affected some areas of the final product. For example, while I had planned to polish the CSS to create a fully refined and consistent design, time constraints and shifting priorities meant that certain aspects, such as font and website scaling and mobile optimisation, were left incomplete. I initially aimed to include all functional requirements such as articles and forums alongside the Pomodoro timer and study planner but as development progressed, it became clear that implementing every feature at once reduced the time available for refinement and testing.
